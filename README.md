# DOM_Intro_Exercise

Practice manipulating the DOM!

In a separate JS file:

When the page loads:

- change the greeting from "Hello, There!" to "Hello, World!".

- set the background color of each `<li>` to `yellow`.

Afterwards: 

3. add the class of `selected` to an `<li>` when it is clicked.

4. change the image to be the most recently clicked food item.

5. when the reset button is clicked - remove the `selected` class from
  each `<li>` and change the image to `panic.jpeg`.
