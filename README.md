# DOM_Intro_Exercise

Practice manipulating the DOM!

In the Chrome JS console practice selecting different elements on the page and doing something with it.

For example:

- When you click the word "milk", have an alert pop up that says "Milk"
- When you click the word "wine" make the letters turn red
- Can you think of any other fun events to make happen?
